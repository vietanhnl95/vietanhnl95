Hi! I am working on lots of different personal projects (webs, data products, analyses, ..), but many of them have not been published here as I feel that I need more improvement to deliver quality content. However, you can still check out some of my likely-to-be-finished projects here:

- <a href="https://github.com/vietanhnl95/C4E13_FinalProject_TeamDaiSo">Basic Web Development Capstone project at MindX</a>
